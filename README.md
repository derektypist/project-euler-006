# Project Euler 006 - Sum Square Difference

The sum of squares of the first 10 natural numbers is:

    `(1*1) + (2*2) + ... + (10*10) = 385`

The square of the sum of the first 10 natural numbers is:

    `(1+2+...+10) * (1+2+...+10) = 55*55 = 3025`

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is `3025 - 385 = 2640`.

The aim is to find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers and the square of the sum.
